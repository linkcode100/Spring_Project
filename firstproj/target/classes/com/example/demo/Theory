1]In JVM -> spring container -> will have objects called spring beans (objs that spring specifies)]
2]2 different scopes while creating spring beans -> 1]Singleton
                                                 -> 2]Prototype  [BOTH IN CORE APPLICATIONS]

3]@Component -> tells spring to make bean of that class
4]By default Spring uses singleton pattern -> 1] Creates object once even if 
                                                 getBean method is not used by developer.
                                              2]If getBean method is used more than once , then also for one class 
                                                object is created only once.
                                                
5]If we mention @Scope(value="prototype") after @Component above a class -> 1]Object will be created only if there is 
                                                                              a getBean method
                                                                            2]Number of times getBean methos is used that many times 
                                                                              object will be created of class which has @Component
                                                                              
6]getBean + @Component + @Scope -> Dependency Injection

7]Use @Autowired when a object on one class needs object of other class 
8]@Autowired by default will search an object by its type not name
9]@Component will create object of class named Cat as cat by default -> we can change the name of the object created by giving the name in bracket
  i.e @Component("cat123")
  
10]Using @Qualifier("cat123") after @Autowired will tell spring to search for object named cat123 and not search by default according to type
11]@Qualifier("newName") can be used with @Component("newName")
